  <h1>Made of Honour</h1>
  <p><strong>Made of Honour</strong> is a weekly thank-you series to those who shaped me. Inspired by my mother’s words—“When someone removes a thorn for you, remember their name”—I’m honouring the mentors and moments that made me who I am. One post, every week. One name, never forgotten.</p>

  <h2>Post 1: The First Stone</h2>
  <p class="quote">"When someone removes a thorn for you, remember their name. Never forget them."</p>

  <p>My mother once said this to me—and I’ve carried it with me ever since. It taught me that honour isn't just inherited; it's lived, earned, and most of all, remembered.</p>

  <p>This project begins with her. She was the first builder of my life. She laid the foundation not with wealth or comfort, but with values, sacrifice, and unshakable love. She made me who I am. She taught me that honour begins at home—with integrity, kindness, and the courage to do the right thing, even when no one is watching.</p>

  <p>So today, I begin this series where my story began—with her name in my heart, her wisdom in my bones, and her example in everything I do.</p>

  <p>This one’s for you, Azra.</p>
