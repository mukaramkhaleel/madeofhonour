    <h1>Made of Honour</h1>
    <p><strong>Made of Honour</strong> is a weekly thank-you series to those who shaped me. Small gestures. Big moments. One post every week. One name never forgotten.</p>

    <h2>Post 2: Half a Ladoo</h2>

    <p>All my life, I never had a full Cadbury.</p>

    <p>It was always shared ‚Äî one half for me, one half for my mother. It wasn‚Äôt about the chocolate. It was about the bond. A quiet, wordless ritual.</p>

    <p>That small act defined what sweetness meant to me ‚Äî not more, just enough. Shared.</p>

    <p>Years later, I was working at Rakuten in the World Trade Center. A fast-moving startup. My desk was near finance and HR ‚Äî the unofficial snack corner of the office. If you were ever hungry, you‚Äôd find something there.</p>

    <p>Six months before that, I had lost my mother. And with her, the sharing ended. Not just the Cadburys ‚Äî the feeling. The small gestures. The pauses in the middle of life where love shows up as something simple.</p>

    <p>Then one afternoon, someone from finance brought ladoos. Someone who didn‚Äôt know my story walked up and handed me half a ladoo.</p>

    <p>Just half. No explanation.</p>

    <p>And in that moment, it all came rushing back ‚Äî the shape. The silence. The feeling of home.</p>

    <p>My body remembered before my mind did. It was like the universe reached through someone else to remind me:</p>

    <div class="quote">‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still with you.‚Äù</div>

    <p>No one‚Äôs ever done that for me again. And maybe no one ever will. But to the person who shared that half ladoo ‚Äî you gave me something sacred.</p>

    <div class="quote">Some sweetness doesn‚Äôt come in full pieces.<br>And some moments don‚Äôt come twice.</div>

    <p>If this story stays with you‚Ä¶ maybe next time you‚Äôll share your sweet too. Not because you have to. But because someone, somewhere, might really need it.</p>
